# Deep Convolutional GAN
This project involves creating a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to generate realistic images for the Fashion MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 grayscale images of 28x28 pixels across 10 categories of fashion items such as clothing, footwear, and accessories. The DCGAN architecture will include a generator network that creates images from random noise and a discriminator network that distinguishes between real and generated images. Through an adversarial training process, where the generator and discriminator are trained simultaneously, the model aims to produce high-quality, visually appealing fashion images that are indistinguishable from the original dataset. This project demonstrates the capability of GANs to enhance data augmentation and creative design.
